This project is about Fischerâ€™s Linear Analysis using Python, numpy and math-
plotlib modules. Had generate a normal distribution for given means and found
the decision boundry and represented in the graphical form. For the graphical
representation in 3D form using mean and covariance by varying them. Also
found accuracy for each analysis.

## Part 1
- Generating the Data

## Part 2
- Varying the mean and plotting the 3D plot using MatPlotLib

# Part 3 
- Varying the covariance and plotting the 3D plot using MatPlotLib
